# Machine-Learning-Programming
This repository contains the first assignment for the Machine Learning Programming course (AIDI 1002). The assignment focuses on data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, performing normality tests, and applying encoding and scaling methods to a dataset. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to achieving these tasks.
